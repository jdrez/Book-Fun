Name: Josh Dresner
    This program models friendships between people and allows the people to ask for and give books.
The program creates people and then adds friends to those people, it also adds books to those people.
Note that one can only borrow a book from someone he/she is friends with. When a person wants to ask
for a book they essentially type in a "keyword", which then compares to the description of each book that
person's friends have. The description of a book is just a string in this format "title, author, genre".
It then displays a list of all the matches. There are some things I would like to improve. For one, when
it is displaying the list of all matches it only shows the books name, I would like to display the entire
description as well as the edition to account for books in a series or books with the same name. I would
also like to add in a breath first search, that searches through the friends, and then the friends friends
next, and then the friends friends friends after, and so on. This would require a recursive method in the
Person class.
